<h4>
Attribute Complexity (AC)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
Defined as the sum of each
attribute's

 weight in the class.
</p>
<p>
You can set up weights for types, the enum type and the array type separately.
Use <code>"*"</code> to define types of a
package
 with all its
subpackages

. For example, 
<code>java.lang.*</code>


 means that the row defines all classes of the
<code>java.lang</code>


package
 and its
subpackages

. To process all types not listed in the table, specify the last row as <code>"*"</code>.
</p>
<p>
The row order is important, because checking of 
attributes goes from the top 
of the table downwards. (Repetitions of a type aren't counted, so if a specific type 
follows a more general type that already included it, the specific type isn't counted. 
For example,
<code>java.lang.*</code>


won't be counted if it comes after
<code>java.*</code>


.)
