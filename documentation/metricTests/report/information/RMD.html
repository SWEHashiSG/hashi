Normalized Distance (RMD)

<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>

<p>RMD measures the distance of a package from the idealized line.</p>



<p>Often referred to as `The Perpendicular Distance of a Package from the Idealized Line A + I = 1,' 
this metric measures the square of the distance of the package from the main sequence A + I = 1, where the ideal value is D = 0. 
The primary rationale is that abstractness and stability of packages are closely connected.</p> 

<p>The RMD of the point (Io, Ao) from the idealized line is: D = |Io + Ao - 1| / (2^0.5). </p>
