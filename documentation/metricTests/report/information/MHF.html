</p>
<p>
This measure is from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite. 
It is calculated as a fraction. The numerator is the sum of the invisibilities 
of all methods defined in all classes. The invisibility of a method 
is the percentage of the total classes (excluding the class owner of method) 
from which this method is not visible. The denominator is the total number 
of methods defined in the project.
