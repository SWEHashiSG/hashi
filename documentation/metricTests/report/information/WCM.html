Weighted Chancging Methods (WCM)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
For each method that would be counted by the CM metric, 
we attach a "weight" to it. The weight is defined as the number
of distinct members from the server-class that are referenced in that method.
</p>
<p>
WCM is computed as the sum of the weights of
all the methods affected by changes.
