<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
The size of the response set for the class includes methods in the class's
inheritance hierarchy and methods that can be invoked on other objects.
A class, which provides a larger response set, is considered to be more complex
and require more effort in testing than one with a smaller overall design complexity.
This measure is calculated as the 'Number Of Operations' + 'Number Of Remote Methods'.
