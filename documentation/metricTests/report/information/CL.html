Class Locality (CL)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
CL is computed as the relative number of dependencies 
that a class has in its own package
.
</p>
<p>
CL is computed by dividing the number of local classes on which the 
measured class depends by the total number of classes on which it depends;<br>
number of local classes is computed by subtracting <code>NOED</code> value from the total
number of classes on which the measured class depends:<br>

<br>

<code>(numOfImportedClasses - NOED)/numOfImportedClasses</code>
<br>

<br>
where <code>numOfImportedClasses</code> is the total number of classes the measured class depends on, and the 
<code>NOED</code> is the number of its external dependencies.
