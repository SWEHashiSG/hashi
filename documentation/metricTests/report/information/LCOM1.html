<h4>
Lack of Cohesion of Methods 1 (LCOM1)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
Takes each pair of methods in the class and determines the set of
fields they each access. If they have disjoint sets of field accesses,
increase the count P by one. If they share at least one field access,
then increase Q by one. After considering each pair of methods:
</p>
<code>
RESULT = (P &gt; Q) ? (P - Q) : 0
</code>
<p>
A low value indicates high coupling between methods, which indicates a high testing
effort because many methods can affect the same a 
attributes and potentially has low reusability.
The definition of this metric was provided by Chidamber and Kemerer in 1993.
