Weighted Methods Per Class 2 (WMPC2)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
This metric is intended to measure the complexity of a class, 
assuming that a class with more methods than another is more complex, 
and that a method with more parameters than another is also likely 
to be more complex.
</p>
<p>
The metric counts methods and parameters for a class. Only methods 
specified in a class are included, that is, any methods inherited 
from a parent are excluded.
