<h4>
Lack Of Cohesion Of Methods 3 (LCOM3)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>

<p>Measures the dissimilarity of methods in a class by its 
attributes.</p>


<p>Consider:<br>
m - number of methods in a class<br>
a - number of 
attributes in a class<br>
mA - number of methods that access 
an attribute<br>
EmA - sum of mA for each 
attribute<br>

<br>
Then:<br>
RESULT = 100*(EmA/a-m)/(1-m)</p>


<p>The definition of this metric was proposed by Henderson-Sellers in 1995.
A low value indicates good class subdivision, implying simplicity and high reusability.
A high lacking of cohesion increases complexity, thereby increasing the likelihood of 
errors during the development process.</p>

<p>If there are no more than one method in a class, LCOM3 is undefined.
If there are no variables in a class, LCOM3 is undefined. An undefined LCOM3 is displayed as -1.
Methods that do not access any class variables are not taken into account.</p>
