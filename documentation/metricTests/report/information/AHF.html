<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
This measure is from the MOOD (Metrics for Object-Oriented Development) suite. 
It is calculated as a fraction. The numerator is the sum of the invisibilities 
of all 
attributes defined in all classes. The invisibility of 
an attribute 
is the percentage of the total classes (excluding the class owner of 
attribute) 
from which this 
attribute is not visible. The denominator is the total number 
of 
attributes defined in the project.
