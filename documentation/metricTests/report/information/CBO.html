<h4>
Coupling Between Objects (CBO)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
Represents the number of other classes to which a class is coupled to.
Counts the number of reference types that are used in 
attribute declarations,
formal parameters, return types, throws declarations, local variables,
and types from which 
attribute and method selections are made.

Primitive types, types from <code>java.lang</code> package
 and supertypes are not counted.

</p>
<p>
Excessive coupling between objects is detrimental to modular design and
prevents reuse. The more independent a class is, the easier it is to reuse
it in another application. In order to improve modularity and promote
encapsulation, inter-object class coupling should be kept to a minimum.
The larger the number of coupling, the higher the sensitivity to changes
in other parts of the design, and therefore maintenance is more difficult.
A measure of coupling is useful to determine how complex the testing of
various parts of a design is likely to be. The higher the inter-object
class coupling, the more rigorous the testing needs to be.
