<h4>
Method Invocation Coupling  (MIC)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p> 
MIC is the (relative) number of other 
classes to which a certain class sends messages.</p>
<p>MIC<sub>norm</sub> = n<sub><font size="-1">MIC</font></sub>/(N -1)</p>
<p>where N is the total number of classes defined in the project, 
and n<sub><font size="-1">MIC</font></sub> the number of 
classes to which messages are sent.</p>
<p>
<b>Viewpoints.</b> These viewpoints 
summarize the impact that coupling has 
on some external 
attributes.</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>
<b>Maintainability.</b> 
The maintenance of a strongly coupled class 
(high MIC value) is more difficult to do because of 
its dependency on the classes it is coupled to.</li>

<li>
<b>Comprehensibility.</b> A strongly coupled 
class is more difficult to understand, as its 
understanding implies a partial (or sometimes total) 
understanding of the classes it is coupled to.</li>

<li>
<b>Error-prone and Testability.</b> Errors in 
a class is directly proportional to the number of 
couplings to other classes. Consequently high coupling 
has a negative impact on testability.</li>

</ol>
<p>
<b>Observations</b>
</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>The proposed definition of MIC is obviously a 
normalized one. Although this has advantages, but for some 
viewpoints, like maintainability, it is more important 
to operate on the absolute values, i.e. the number of 
classes to which it is coupled.</li>

<li>For some viewpoints it might be important to 
count only the couplings of the system to user-defined 
classes, i.e. exclude the library classes.</li>
