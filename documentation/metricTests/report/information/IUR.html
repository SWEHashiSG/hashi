<h4>
Inheritance Usage Ratio (IUR)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
The IUR metric is a metric defined between a subclass and
one of its ancestor classes.  It is the relative number of 
inheritance-specific members from the ancestor class used in the
derived class.
</p>
<p>
A member of an ancestor class is an 
inheritance-specific member if its usage is related to inheritance.
We identify the following inheritance-specific members:
<ul>

<li> protected data members and methods;</li>

<li> non-private virtual methods.</li>

</ul>

The IUR is computed by counting the number of inheritance-specific
members of the ancestor class that are used in the subclass, and then 
divide it by the total numbers of inheritance-specific members
from the ancestor. The only usages that are counted are: the access of
protected data members, the call of protected methods and the redefinition
of a virtual method.
