Weighted Methods Per Class 1 (WMPC1)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
This metric is the sum of the complexity of all methods for a class, 
where each method is weighted by its cyclomatic complexity. 
The number of methods and the complexity of the methods involved 
is a predictor of how much time and effort is required to develop and 
maintain the class. Only methods specified in a class are included, 
that is, any methods inherited from a parent are excluded.
