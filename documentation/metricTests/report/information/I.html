<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
Instability is:
</p>
<pre>
  I = NOED / (NOED + NCC)
</pre>
<p>This metric was proposed by Robert C. Martin and
measures the instability of packages
,
where stability is measured by calculating the effort
to change a package
 without impacting 
other packages
 within
the application. The number of incoming and outgoing dependencies is
one indicator determining the stability and instability
of a package
, where:
</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>Packages
 that contain multiple outgoing but few incoming dependencies are less
stable because of the consequences of changes in these packages
.</li>

<li>Packages
 containing more incoming dependencies 
are more stable because they are more difficult to change.</li>

<li>0% indicates a maximally stable package
 and 100% indicates a maximally unstable
package
.</li> 

<li>Designs of packages
 should intentionally be made 
as stable [ 0%,30% ] or unstable [ 70%,100% ] as possible.</li>
