<h4>
Essential Complexity (EC)
</h4>
<p>
<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
The essential complexity, ev(G), of a method is calculated by first removing 
structured programming primitives from the method's 
control flow graph until the graph cannot be reduced any further,
and then calculating the cyclomatic complexity, v(G), of the reduced graph.</p>
<p>An immediate consequence is that 1 &lt;= ev(G) &lt;= v(G).
A somewhat less obvious consequence, which can help when
evaluating complexity analysis tools, is that ev(G) can never be equal to 2.
This is because after all sequential nodes have been eliminated,
the only graphs with v(G) equal to 2 are structured programming primitives,
which can then be removed to get an ev(G) of 1.</p>
<p>The reduction proceeds from the deepest level of nesting outward,
which means that a primitive construct can be removed only when
 no other constructs are nested within it.</p>
