<i>Description:</i>
</p>
<p>
NOAM counts the number of operations added by a class.
Inherited and overridden operations are not counted.
Classes without parents are not processed. The large
value of this measure indicates that the functionality
of the given class becomes increasingly distinct from
that of the parent classes. In this case, it should be
considered whether this class should genuinely be
inheriting from the parent or if it could be broken
down into several smaller classes.
